# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

The main goal here is to use the best practices and patterns to build a scalable and reliable system, I used an event driven architecture implementing the Outbox pattern to ensure the consistency of the data and be able to scale the system horizontally.

## High-level Architecture

Transaction Consistency and Atomicity

- SAGA Pattern Implementation:
  - Manages distributed transactions as a sequence of local transactions
  - Each service performs its transaction and publishes an event when complete


- Event Sourcing: All steps in a transaction are recorded as immutable events, providing a complete audit trail and enabling system recovery
- Eventual Consistency Model: Services maintain local consistency with eventual consistency across the system
- Idempotent Operations: Services are designed to handle duplicate events safely, ensuring operations can be retried without side effects

Regulatory and compliance

- Audit Service: Captures metadata about every operation including who, what, when, and from where
- Reporting Service: Generates required regulatory reports from event data

Security service

- Encryption Service: End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Country regulation: Here is where we adapt every regulation strategy for each country

Scaling During Peak Periods

- Microservices Architecture: Allows independent scaling of individual services
- Auto-scaling Service: Monitors metrics and automatically adjusts resources
- Event-Driven Design: Handles peak loads through asynchronous processing
- Message Queuing: Buffers transaction requests during peak periods
